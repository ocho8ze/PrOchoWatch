# PrOchoWatch

**PrOchoWatch** is a lightweight **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)** written in **pure Python (standard library only)**.  
It detects the execution of unauthorized or suspicious processes, monitors the integrity of critical files, and analyzes system logs to generate alerts in near real-time.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Create a baseline and detect file additions, deletions, or modifications in critical directories (`/etc`, `/usr/bin`, etc.).  
- **Log Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system logs (`/var/log/auth.log`) with regex rules (SSH failures, sudo misuse, GTFOBins exploitation, etc.).  
- **Process Monitoring**: Detect suspicious processes (deleted binaries still running, processes started from `/tmp`, blacklisted malware such as cryptominers, fake system daemons).  
- **Alerting**: Unified alerts to console, JSONL file, and application log.  
- **Modes**: Continuous monitoring (service-like) or one-shot scanning.

## üìÇ Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ocho8sze/PrOchoWatch.git
cd PrOchoWatch

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Initialize the FIM baseline:
```bash
sudo python3 PrOchoWatch.py --init-baseline```

Start continuous monitoring:
```bash
sudo python3 PrOchoWatch.py```

Run a one-shot scan:
```bash
sudo python3 PrOchoWatch.py --once ````

## üìë Example Alerts
```bash
[HIGH] PROC/BLACKLIST: Forbidden process detected: /tmp/xmrig
[HIGH] FIM/MODIFIED: Modification detected in /etc/passwd
[HIGH] LOG/SSH_FAIL: Failed password for invalid user admin from 192.168.1.10```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The tool uses a JSON configuration file: PrOchoWatchConf.json.
Example:
```json
{
  "fim": {
    "paths": ["/etc", "/usr/bin", "/usr/sbin", "/tmp"],
    "interval_sec": 300
  },
  "logmon": {
    "files": ["/var/log/auth.log"],
    "rules": [
      {"id": "SSH_FAIL", "pattern": "Failed password for", "severity": "high"}
    ]
  },
  "procmon": {
    "interval_sec": 5,
    "suspicious_path_prefixes": ["/tmp", "/dev/shm", "/var/tmp"],
    "blacklist_names": ["xmrig", "kinsing", "minerd"]
  }
}```
You can adapt these parameters for your own environment (directories, rules, blacklisted processes‚Ä¶).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Relies on polling (periodic scans), no direct kernel integration.
May produce false positives depending on the environment.
Requires administrator privileges for full functionality.
