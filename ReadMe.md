# PrOchoWatch

**PrOchoWatch** is a lightweight **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)** written in **pure Python (standard library only)**.  
It detects the execution of unauthorized or suspicious processes, monitors the integrity of critical files, and analyzes system logs to generate alerts in near real-time.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Create a baseline and detect file additions, deletions, or modifications in critical directories (`/etc`, `/usr/bin`, etc.).  
- **Log Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system logs (`/var/log/auth.log`) with regex rules (SSH failures, sudo misuse, GTFOBins exploitation, etc.).  
- **Process Monitoring**: Detect suspicious processes (deleted binaries still running, processes started from `/tmp`, blacklisted malware such as cryptominers, fake system daemons).  
- **Alerting**: Unified alerts to console, JSONL file, and application log.  
- **Modes**: Continuous monitoring (service-like) or one-shot scanning.
